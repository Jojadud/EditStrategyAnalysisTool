mobile1	Thanks, I will look at it tonight.
mobile7	This will be hard.
mobile8	Hopefully it cheered you up a bit.
mobile9	We are working on this as we speak.
mobile13	Have a good evening.
mobile14	Sounds good to me.
mobile15	Yes I am here actually.
mobile16	Tonight is my anniversary.
mobile18	Will follow up today.
mobile19	That's a lot of dollars.
mobile20	Are you going to join us for lunch?
mobile21	Thanks for the surprise.
mobile25	I can't find it on my Blackberry.
mobile26	And how would I be going for work?
mobile28	I hoped you did.
mobile32	OK to make changes, change out original.
mobile38	We'll let you know.
mobile47	Yes I am coming twice.
mobile50	Sorry I'm losing it.
mobile52	If not, he's gone on Tuesday.
mobile56	Thanks so much for the message.
mobile60	Let me know if I can do anything.
mobile61	No, but thank you for offering.
mobile68	If so he probably will have to pay back.
mobile69	He can't help himself.
mobile72	I haven't heard back from Steve at all.
mobile73	I have already approved and forwarded.
mobile76	Thanks for your offer.
mobile78	Was it a car wreck?
mobile88	Is the system running OK this morning?
mobile89	Is she done yet?
mobile93	Do you have copies of the agreements?
mobile95	Thanks for the quick turnaround.
mobile97	Have a good weekend.
mobile103	See you on Friday.
mobile107	More bad Enron news?
mobile108	I think we are doing OK.
mobile109	Michael has his holiday performance.
mobile114	The only change would be the date.
mobile121	Please send to Hartsoe for comment.
mobile122	We are headed to Austin tomorrow.
mobile124	I didn't hear from Ginger this week.
mobile125	Thus have nothing to destroy.
mobile127	He is pretty tapped into it all.
mobile128	I am out of town until Friday.
mobile129	Wish me luck with Linda.
mobile130	Yes, I am playing.
mobile131	Can you call me at home?
mobile134	Mostly a social call.
mobile135	We will sign tomorrow and fund Tuesday.
mobile139	Please call tomorrow if possible.
mobile140	We are all fragile.
mobile144	It will probably be tomorrow.
mobile148	I would like to attend if so.
mobile149	It better not be about me!
mobile152	He played goalie almost the entire game.
mobile155	I can return earlier.
mobile156	I am trying again.
mobile160	I am on my way to Heaven.
mobile161	Would you mind taking the lead on this?
mobile174	I will bring John Brindle.
mobile178	Need you or John to step out.
mobile182	Chad thought we were on a treasure hunt.
mobile193	He would love anything about rocks.
mobile198	What do you hear?
mobile201	Thanks I needed that today!
mobile202	I will review them on Monday.
mobile203	Maybe I should just stay there for good.
mobile206	No problem Maria, please contact Rick.
mobile210	A bit behind on my emails.
mobile211	Then we can go to Zainy Brainy.
mobile212	Hope your trip to Florida was good.
mobile216	Hi, how are things there?
mobile217	What is your issue sir?
mobile220	What a nice note.
mobile221	I told Gary you could make the call.
mobile224	I think we should consider this request.
mobile233	I'm on my way back there to do so.
mobile235	Bound to be some media flack on this.
mobile240	Be back tomorrow and maybe we can visit.
mobile245	Neal, can you help with this?
mobile253	Best of luck and stay in touch.
mobile255	John, thanks for the update.
mobile260	I was answering Janet's comment.
mobile262	So should I drive tomorrow?
mobile270	I have a favor to ask.
mobile274	I'm still in Dallas!
mobile276	We are on the road to Palacios.
mobile281	It reads like she is in.
mobile283	Is Cassandra there today?
mobile287	I like Nick and Everett.
mobile288	Shouldn't be too hard though.
mobile290	In a couple of weeks.
mobile291	Has Dynegy made a specific request?
mobile292	I am walking in now.
mobile294	They have capacity now.
mobile299	Will he come down Wetheimer?
mobile310	A gift isn't necessary.
mobile313	Tell her to get my expense report done.
mobile314	I am out of town on business tonight.
mobile318	We need a process to deal with this.
mobile319	I'm waiting until she comes home.
mobile322	See you next week.
mobile323	This is the neatest toy I have had.
mobile329	Chris Foster is in!
mobile334	They are more efficiently pooled.
mobile337	I have other things to worry about!
mobile342	This is a problem for timing of restart.
mobile344	Let's discuss in the morning.
mobile349	Same camp as Davies, Lagrasta.
mobile362	I think Tim wants to move quickly.
mobile363	If Motley is in we are out of money.
mobile366	Please let James and Kathy know.
mobile367	I want to thank everyone involved.
mobile379	Forward it in to Steve for approval.
mobile381	Let me know if the plan is different.
mobile385	Producers reacting to price management.
mobile391	It has been very rough this week.
mobile395	Just wanted to touch base.
mobile396	Not like you'll get paid for it.
mobile397	I am getting home early.
mobile399	Thanks again for your help.
mobile401	I'll be thinking of you.
mobile402	Has Brian had his contract yet?
mobile404	Could you try ringing her?
mobile405	What a crazy day.
mobile409	Do you need it today?
mobile412	Will call later to explain.
mobile414	Joel will handle this.
mobile415	The contract is a bit complicated.
mobile416	Steve Gilbert is working on this.
mobile423	What is going on?
mobile425	Your kind thoughts are appreciated.
mobile426	Tax gave us the same feedback.
mobile431	I will be thinking of you.
mobile434	John this message concerns me.
mobile435	Did we plan that?
mobile437	This will make my week.
mobile439	I am glad that things are going well.
mobile442	Need anything from Target?
mobile444	Lynn and Steve will attend for me.
mobile448	I will be late on day one.
mobile452	I think I get this everyday now.
mobile453	Add it all up, we have a problem.
mobile456	Today has been hard for me.
mobile457	Let me know if I miss anything.
mobile460	I'll probably page you.
mobile461	Couldn't risk the uncertainty.
mobile464	Call me to give me a heads up.
mobile467	And leave my school alone.
mobile469	I will be there.
mobile479	What is in the plan?
mobile482	I have no idea.
mobile483	They said it was supposed to snow here.
mobile484	I'll get you details.
mobile485	Do you and George have a thing going?
mobile489	Anything exciting going on today?
mobile497	I'm looking forward to the long weekend!
mobile498	Do we need to do anything here?
mobile503	Because there is traffic.
mobile504	I am fine with this.
mobile515	Presumably so do you.
mobile519	What is happening to the stock price?
mobile521	We have the data.
mobile524	Once you do, you can never go back.
mobile526	Should I bring you something back?
mobile533	Where do I go for lunch?
mobile534	Let's discuss the charges.
mobile536	And I can't turn my phone on.
mobile537	A letter is being sent today.
mobile538	I might have something at the office.
mobile541	Can you help with this one?
mobile544	Are you going to apply?
mobile547	Any news from Redmond?
mobile548	Will you call me or should I call you?
mobile552	Fran, yes please update.
mobile553	Let me know if it goes any lower.
mobile558	Presuming we can afford headcount?
mobile559	Milly is a seller.
mobile561	I am almost speechless.
mobile563	Ava, please put me on the list.
mobile565	I am now officially a Blackberry addict.
mobile569	Take what you can get.
mobile572	I have no documents on this transaction.
mobile576	Should systems manage the migration?
mobile579	Is Carol going back to swaps?
mobile582	Need before board meeting.
mobile587	I've got a call into Bowen.
mobile588	I think that is the right answer.
mobile590	Next time ask Jim to call me.
mobile596	I'm glad you liked it.
mobile597	Thanks for all your support.
mobile600	I am out of town on business.
mobile601	I've never worked with her.
mobile602	Get with Mary for format.
mobile605	I hope you are feeling better.
mobile606	I will be in the office tomorrow.
mobile607	I'm glad she likes her tree.
mobile609	Have a great trip.
mobile611	Tried reaching you earlier.
mobile615	I would expect an answer ASAP.
mobile619	Did you talk to Ava this morning?
mobile620	We have lots of paper stuff.
mobile621	We can discuss options early next week.
mobile623	It's not looking too good is it?
mobile624	Has anyone else heard anything?
mobile625	I went to see a doctor.
mobile628	Hope you don't freeze tonight.
mobile632	Did you see Laura's message?
mobile641	I'll get you one.
mobile642	Seems unusual to me.
mobile644	I just tracked down Steve.
mobile646	I thought it had gone to all of Enron.
mobile647	What will happen to this project?
mobile649	Mark Ellenberg is off for Passover.
mobile657	Yes we need to get it in ASAP.
mobile658	I am snowed under and out of the office.
mobile659	I plan to be in the office tomorrow.
mobile671	I'll just have her call Tracy.
mobile674	I am looking forward to the salad.
mobile681	You can talk to Becky!
mobile683	Met with partners in San Francisco.
mobile688	I talked to Duran.
mobile693	I agreed terms with Greg.
mobile696	I'll see what I can find out for you.
mobile697	What did you and Ava decide to do?
mobile698	I will talk with Jim Fallon and lawyers.
mobile699	I am at the lake.
mobile700	I wish he would leave Deerfield alone.
mobile702	I told you silly.
mobile707	Can you do the Gallup contracts as well?
mobile708	Apologize to Steve Dowd for me.
mobile709	Thanks for your concern.
mobile713	Thursday works better for me.
mobile717	Will reveal as appropriate.
mobile728	I am all over it.
mobile729	I am on a plane, sorry.
mobile737	I guess that's additive to my stretch?
mobile742	He especially loved the special kiss.
mobile743	Did you hear Alice quit?
mobile747	Heading in to see Moody's.
mobile751	Little value to the pipes.
mobile752	Just looking to gossip.
mobile753	Did he get a signing bonus?
mobile756	What is the mood?
mobile757	Tracey is coming next weekend.
mobile759	I have some more data coming.
mobile762	Do we want to contest, if possible?
mobile764	John Millar to report.
mobile771	Never mind, I already deleted it.
mobile776	When do you have to be there?
mobile778	He says he has some ideas.
mobile781	I hear Tim has huge problems.
mobile783	We are about to leave Heaven!
mobile784	Rescinding is what you meant to say.
mobile785	I am on my way.
mobile786	Please leave it to Brian.
mobile788	I sent you a message earlier today.
mobile794	Do we need to discuss?
mobile797	Just playing with you!
mobile802	Tammie please forward to Duran.
mobile803	Looking for some gift hints from you.
mobile805	Have a good trip.
mobile806	I haven't visited with Stan lately.
mobile807	They may want to discuss with you.
mobile811	What's your phone number?
mobile817	Have you talked to Somerholder?
mobile821	Thanks for checking with me.
mobile822	This is very sensitive.
mobile826	What is the stock price doing?
mobile830	Thank you for your call.
mobile831	Can we have them until we move?
mobile834	On the plane, doors closing.
mobile835	What did Mark say?
mobile837	I'll catch up with you tomorrow.
mobile839	Treasa knows the details.
mobile840	Are you in today?
mobile841	Have you done any deals yet?
mobile845	Talk to you tomorrow.
mobile851	Not in the near future.
mobile854	Let me know where you might be.
mobile856	Good to know it exists.
mobile858	Wasn't nearly as bad as I thought.
mobile860	Do you know anything?
mobile866	I'll let you know when I figure it out!
mobile867	I think that Pam Butler called him.
mobile868	Would you mind doing the following?
mobile871	Dallas and I am not coming back!
mobile878	The SoCal meeting was very beneficial.
mobile881	Have a great evening!
mobile882	But I believe answer will be yes.
mobile891	We just need a sitter.
mobile892	I will leave my Blackberry on.
mobile893	We must be consistent.
mobile895	Did you tell Steve?
mobile896	She has absolutely everything.
mobile899	Is this the conference rate?
mobile903	Thanks for taking the lead on this.
mobile905	This is a most unfortunate news release.
mobile907	This is good I think.
mobile908	It is not surprising.
mobile910	Let me know how I can help.
mobile911	Please send to Gary Smith.
mobile912	We can have wine and catch up.
mobile918	You just can't work without me can you?
mobile919	Don't they have some conflicts here?
mobile921	On my way down.
mobile923	Please pass along my thanks, though.
mobile926	Can you get me the Calger letter done?
mobile935	They are firmly sitting on the fence.
mobile936	Happy Holidays to you and your staff.
mobile944	Is this a standard language?
mobile947	I'm on a conference call.
mobile951	No obligation to pay.
mobile953	What does Hunter think?
mobile955	Money wise that is.
mobile962	Trip was good I presume?
mobile966	That was so sweet.
mobile971	Marisa sent the invoices.
mobile972	We need to bring them along slowly.
mobile974	Get with David Lund.
mobile976	Weather is bad here.
mobile980	In a meeting with your guys now.
mobile982	I am up with Stan if you need me.
mobile983	I'll try to sit down with him next week.
mobile985	How long can you guys shop?
mobile986	He will be available via phone.
mobile987	Is Terry pulling his hair out yet?
mobile988	Glad you weren't in an accident today.
mobile991	Thanks for your kind words.
mobile998	Talk to you later.
mobile1003	Hopefully this can wait until Monday.
mobile1005	I'm fully recovered and back on pace.
mobile1007	I am not concerned with the Brown money.
mobile1011	No employment claims for gas or power.
mobile1015	On my way back.
mobile1018	I am freaking out!
mobile1021	Maybe you can leave early.
mobile1025	What happened with Brent Price?
mobile1026	Will be a while.
mobile1028	Why do you ask?
mobile1031	Don't forget to pray.
mobile1038	I love you too.
mobile1044	Mike, are you aware of this?
mobile1047	I'd be happy to.
mobile1049	This looks fine with me.
mobile1054	She has a web address.
mobile1055	You have a lot of holes in your plan.
mobile1058	Did you not read my first email?
mobile1059	I was planning to attend.
mobile1060	That would be great.
mobile1063	Thank you for your prompt reply.
mobile1067	Can you wait until Monday?
mobile1070	Can you help me here?
mobile1071	I know several who work there.
mobile1072	I changed that in one prior draft.
mobile1075	Probably will be working.
mobile1077	See you in Enron House when I get back.
mobile1078	What is the cost issue?
mobile1079	I will resend to you.
mobile1080	Please send me an email.
mobile1084	Banks want to exclude goodwill.
mobile1093	Is that enough for this week?
mobile1095	Yes I will be back tonight.
mobile1098	I can look at it tonight.
mobile1102	I'm in a meeting until noon.
mobile1103	Don't know how that happened.
mobile1104	You snooze you lose!
mobile1105	I'll call you to set up a time.
mobile1109	There is a God.
mobile1117	Please send it to both of us.
mobile1118	I will if I want to.
mobile1122	Jan, sorry for the inconvenience.
mobile1125	We are on a plane coming back.
mobile1129	I am sorry you had to come in.
mobile1135	I got it, pal.
mobile1140	Ben could tell him about Pompano.
mobile1141	I think this just happened Friday.
mobile1150	Let me know when you get this.
mobile1151	I wanted to go drinking with you.
mobile1161	I will be back Friday.
mobile1163	Love to all, Kay.
mobile1176	I think it's over now.
mobile1178	It's not working very well.
mobile1182	I agree with Jim.
mobile1184	I need your home cell or whatever.
mobile1192	If not can I call you?
mobile1202	Ava please put on my calendar.
mobile1206	Confirmed with Mark Taylor.
mobile1210	Do you still need me to sign something?
mobile1217	I will be checking up with Lisa.
mobile1218	I will likely not be available.
mobile1226	Still waiting on decision.
mobile1238	How can we get these answers?
mobile1240	You hang in there too.
mobile1247	Both of us are still here.
mobile1251	Not even in yet.
mobile1258	The rest is a byproduct of slapshot.
mobile1261	Still, I'm always up for opera.
mobile1263	Ava, please put on my calendar.
mobile1264	We will keep trying.
mobile1265	Much better than carrying a laptop.
mobile1268	Email the consent to me.
mobile1271	How soon do you need it?
mobile1273	How are things with you?
mobile1275	Michael said his day was rotten.
mobile1277	Nothing but good news everyday.
mobile1281	Message is getting through.
mobile1283	John, can you give Konni a call?
mobile1285	I left a message.
mobile1289	I guess this is OK if you are.
mobile1290	I am not aware of any.
mobile1293	Perhaps there was a glitch.
mobile1299	What number should he call you on?
mobile1301	You can reply via email.
mobile1302	I'll find someone to do it.
mobile1305	Geez, I sound pathetic.
mobile1313	I would like to discuss.
mobile1315	I would like it paid through I Buy It.
mobile1318	I think these will be just fine.
mobile1320	Ava, do we need to worry about this?
mobile1323	What happened to Savita?
mobile1324	Are you feeling better?
mobile1325	You have a nice holiday too.
mobile1329	We need to talk about this month.
mobile1330	How is it going?
mobile1339	I tried that to no avail.
mobile1343	I'm quite interested as I told Lyn.
mobile1347	Maybe stuff we do more of next year.
mobile1349	How do you like the Blackberry?
mobile1350	We are waiting on the cold front.
mobile1351	John Keffer is the one I know best.
mobile1357	Neil has been asking around.
mobile1358	We are having fun.
mobile1361	Got your back while you pick up wine.
mobile1371	I'm big on the Blackberry.
mobile1372	Tried to call but couldn't reach you.
mobile1373	Let me know if I can help.
mobile1375	I had a last minute meeting come up.
mobile1376	I will call when I can.
mobile1377	We'll be back Sunday.
mobile1381	I have been working those.
mobile1383	Maybe Michael will go to Quil tomorrow.
mobile1384	Sorry to keep you in suspense!
mobile1386	I need to go to Stan's office.
mobile1397	Are we ready for this on Monday?
mobile1398	That is not true.
mobile1400	I will handle this afternoon.
mobile1404	I already deleted it.
mobile1405	As you know, it isn't easy.
mobile1409	Yup he can do it by phone.
mobile1413	Please forward to Kevin Howard.
mobile1416	Thanks for the plant.
mobile1419	Are you two talking?
mobile1424	I'm fine with that see you Monday.
mobile1435	Let's wait until Monday.
mobile1439	Are you on the diet with me?
mobile1443	I decided that I am going to stay here!
mobile1444	I have forwarded to Kelly.
mobile1451	Board meeting running long.
mobile1453	Have a great day!
mobile1457	Lavo called it, never mind though.
mobile1460	When do we review with El Paso?
mobile1462	I just had my head in the clouds.
mobile1464	I will not be able to attend.
mobile1465	Would you have John send me a message?
mobile1469	Thanks Dan, we'll look after him.
mobile1470	Wonder what next week will bring.
mobile1483	So you're ignoring me.
mobile1484	I think I'm OK.
mobile1486	Where are they hitting the books at?
mobile1487	Your voice cheered me up.
mobile1488	They're not having the baby then.
mobile1496	I think there are three deals.
mobile1497	Have a Happy Thanksgiving.
mobile1498	We will keep you posted.
mobile1500	I am really not wanting to come back.
mobile1502	Do we have anyone in Portland?
mobile1504	I spoke with Lara Robinson this morning.
mobile1505	Chip Schneider makes that call.
mobile1506	If not, I can try information in Omaha.
mobile1507	OK I thought it was in Washington state.
mobile1512	Will get back to you.
mobile1515	Hope you guys are doing fine.
mobile1516	Are you going to call?
mobile1520	I hope you went.
mobile1521	They have to go away and have a think.
mobile1523	Has it been mentioned yet?
mobile1529	We will address tomorrow with Stan.
mobile1530	I would be glad to participate.
mobile1534	This is all so unreal.
mobile1535	Will give you more shortly.
mobile1537	Sorry for the delay.
mobile1539	Had a great meeting.
mobile1542	Please coordinate with him.
mobile1544	What level of detail do you need?
mobile1547	Let's stay downtown then.
mobile1553	It has made a big difference.
mobile1554	Hope everything is going OK at home.
mobile1555	I know Trey and Cam will be there.
mobile1560	As you know, this stinks.
mobile1561	I'll get with him by phone to confirm.
mobile1568	Have we assigned employees to NetCo?
mobile1573	Am I getting a good package?
mobile1575	We went to Palacios to fish.
mobile1579	Let me know if I can be of help.
mobile1580	Hope all is well.
mobile1581	I worked on the grade level promotion.
mobile1585	I have a request.
mobile1587	Better than most recently.
mobile1590	I will not be available.
mobile1595	I'll send you minutes.
mobile1603	Travis is in charge.
mobile1606	Will call when I leave.
mobile1609	Let's make sure we are ready!
mobile1615	Zero to five percent.
mobile1619	I don't know that I will be back Monday.
mobile1621	That is so sad.
mobile1628	We are in a loop.
mobile1637	What do you think about Tracy and Jim?
mobile1638	Are you in a good mood?
mobile1640	Can you help get this cleared up?
mobile1641	Next week sounds fine for vacation.
mobile1643	I have a high level in my office.
mobile1650	I'm working on a liquidity forecast.
mobile1651	If we don't get it, could be trouble.
mobile1656	Are you being a baby?
mobile1659	Did you get this?
mobile1660	Maybe traffic will be light on Thursday.
mobile1661	Mike is putting pressure on me.
mobile1663	He also will have to honor noncompete.
mobile1669	Kind of like silent fireworks.
mobile1671	Can you get with Mary and make sure?
mobile1676	She has the game tomorrow.
mobile1677	I'm on a plane.
mobile1679	I sent it to her.
mobile1696	I think afraid of mass exodus.
mobile1700	Could you see where this stands?
mobile1710	Yes I like perfume.
mobile1711	I'm going to class.
mobile1716	See you on the third.
mobile1720	Did we get ours back?
mobile1726	Let's leave it until we get going.
mobile1732	Do you have a number for him?
mobile1740	I'll call you in the morning.
mobile1751	Go for the dollars.
mobile1752	I do wish I knew.
mobile1758	I didn't think we had.
mobile1764	So I need your spreadsheets ASAP.
mobile1767	Do you need to be there?
mobile1769	Hope you had a good weekend.
mobile1773	That would be a good idea.
mobile1778	East Coast should be essentially flat.
mobile1779	How's the share price?
mobile1782	I guess we are almost there right?
mobile1787	Jan has a lot of detail.
mobile1788	Need to watch closely.
mobile1789	Do we know what we need?
mobile1790	What do you think?
mobile1800	I can fill you in on more details later.
mobile1802	She is taking over Global Finance Legal.
